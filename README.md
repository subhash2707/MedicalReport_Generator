## ‚ú® Features

*   üìÑ **Document OCR**: Accurately extract text from various document formats (e.g., PDFs, images) using Tesseract.js.
*   üß† **Intelligent Summarization**: Generate concise and coherent summaries of reports, focusing on key information.
*   ‚ö° **Fast Processing**: Optimized backend for efficient handling and summarization of large documents.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Scalable API**: Robust and well-structured API built with Express.js, ready for integration into other applications.
*   üîç **Text Similarity & Relevance**: Utilizes `fuzzball` and `string-similarity` for enhanced text processing and ensuring summary relevance.


## üöÄ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the AI-powered Report Summarizer on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

### Step-by-Step Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/UjjwalBaranwal/AI-powered-Report-Summarizer.git
    cd AI-powered-Report-Summarizer
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you use Yarn
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file will store your environment variables.
    ```
    PORT=3000
    TESSDATA_PREFIX=./
    # Add any other necessary environment variables here
    ```
    *   `PORT`: The port on which the server will run.
    *   `TESSDATA_PREFIX`: Specifies the directory where Tesseract language data files (`.traineddata`) are located. Ensure `eng.traineddata` is accessible at this path.

4.  **Tesseract Language Data**:
    The project includes `eng.traineddata` for English OCR. If you need other languages, you might need to download additional `.traineddata` files from the [Tesseract OCR GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata) and place them in a directory accessible by `TESSDATA_PREFIX`.


## üí° Usage Examples

Once the server is running, you can interact with the summarization API.

### Starting the Server

To start the backend server, run:

```bash
npm start
# or
node server.js
```

The server will typically start on the port specified in your `.env` file (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

### Summarizing a Report via API

You can send a document (e.g., a PDF or an image) to the API for summarization using a tool like `curl` or Postman.

**Example using `curl` (for a PDF file):**

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -F "file=@/path/to/your/report.pdf" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/summarize \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"
```

Replace `/path/to/your/report.pdf` with the actual path to the document you want to summarize. The API will return a JSON response containing the extracted text and its summary.
